# Lightweight Native Database Client in 2026: Installer MB ≠ RAM ≠ UI Stack

> Searching for a **lightweight native database client**? Most pages mix three different numbers into one slogan. This guide separates **installer size**, **steady-state RSS**, and **UI stack** — then shows how to score GoNavi, Electron clients, and JVM tools without comparing apples to oranges.

## The “lightweight” trap

“Lightweight” is the most abused word in database-GUI marketing.

People usually mean one of three different pains:

1. **Download / IT friction** — “Can I get this past a locked laptop and a 50 MB ticket limit?”
2. **RAM while idle** — “Does this sit at 2 GB before I even open a connection?”
3. **Stack tax** — “Am I shipping a whole Chromium (Electron) or a JVM just to edit SQL?”

Those are **not interchangeable**. Quoting a 25 MB installer next to someone else’s 80 MB “native RAM” claim — without methodology — is how comparison posts go wrong.

GoNavi’s product line (and the [README Why GoNavi framing](https://github.com/Syngnat/GoNavi/blob/dev/README.md#why-gonavi)) is built to keep the three columns apart. This article is the longform version of that discipline.

## Three numbers, one scorecard

| Number | What it answers | What it does *not* answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Installer size** | Download size, USB / SCCM friction, “how big is the asset on GitHub Releases?” | How much RAM the UI holds after launch |
| **Steady-state RSS** | Resident memory after idle (label OS, build, connections, display) | How small the `.dmg` / `.msi` is |
| **UI stack** | Electron vs system WebView vs JVM / Qt / pure native | A single “light / heavy” badge without context |

### How to read a vendor claim

| Claim shape | Healthy? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| “Installer ~22 MB (Windows portable v0.9.8)” | Yes | Concrete asset + version |
| “Idle RSS ≈429 MB main on Linux WebKit41, empty workbench, method noted” | Yes | Labeled sample |
| “Native ~80 MB” with no OS, no process list, no idle vs load | No | Unverifiable slogan |
| “Lighter than Electron” while only showing installer MB | Incomplete | Stack claim needs stack evidence; RAM needs RSS |

## What “native” actually means here

In 2026 database-client talk, **native** is overloaded:

- **Native UI toolkit** (AppKit / WinUI / Qt widgets) — pixel-native controls
- **Native host process** (Go / Rust / C++) **wrapping a system WebView** — not shipping Chromium
- **“Feels native” marketing** — often still Electron underneath

GoNavi’s path is the middle one: **Wails = Go backend + system WebView** (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS/Linux builds). That is **not Electron**. It is also **not** a claim that every control is AppKit-drawn. When you compare “native clients,” say which definition you used.

## Scorecard: common client families

Use this as a **decision table**, not a beauty contest.

| Family | Typical UI stack | Installer class (order of magnitude) | RAM conversation | Pick when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Electron SQL clients** (e.g. Beekeeper-class) | Chromium + Node | Often **hundreds of MB** | Chromium baseline; do not confuse with download size | You want polished OSS SQL UX and accept Chromium tax |
| **JVM / Eclipse lineage** (e.g. DBeaver-class) | Java UI | Moderate installers; runtime is the story | Community often reports **multi‑GB** class RSS under real use | You need obscure JDBC drivers |
| **Commercial “native feel” SQL** (e.g. TablePlus-class) | Platform-native leaning | Varies; license walls matter more than MB | Usually fine for relational-only desks | Few RDBMS, love the UX, OK with paid unlocks |
| **IDE SQL** (e.g. DataGrip-class) | JetBrains platform | IDE-class | IDE-class | You already live in JetBrains |
| **GoNavi** | **Go + system WebView (not Electron)** | **~20–26 MB** class (v0.9.8 Win / macOS / Linux assets) | Linux idle sample: main ≈**429 MB**; with WebKit helpers ≈**765 MB** (method below) | One multi-engine cockpit + honest three-number framing |

### GoNavi numbers (labeled, v0.9.8)

| Metric | Value | Method / caveat |
|---|---|---|
| Windows portable | ≈ **20.5 MB** | GitHub Release asset |
| Windows MSI | ≈ **22.7 MB** | GitHub Release asset |
| macOS Arm64 DMG | ≈ **26.1 MB** | GitHub Release asset |
| Linux package | ≈ **21 MB** | GitHub Release asset |
| Linux idle RSS (main) | ≈ **429 MB** | WebKit41 build, empty workbench, no DB connections, remote display, ~30–40 s steady |
| Linux idle RSS (+ WebKit helpers) | ≈ **765 MB** | Same run; helpers counted |
| UI stack | **Go + system WebView** | **Not Electron**; Windows still needs WebView2 runtime on the machine |

> **Installer MB ≠ RAM.** Do not put 20 MB next to 429 MB as if one “wins.” Do not compare either to an unverified “native ~80 MB” marketing line. Windows / macOS laptop RSS may differ — treat the Linux figures as a **labeled sample**, not a leaderboard score.

## Why locked laptops care about installers first

Community complaints (LibreDB-style threads, Reddit / HN adjacent) keep circling the same constraint: *dbeaver + compass + redis gui + ssh… none of that fits on a locked work laptop*.

On those desks, the first gate is often:

- Can I download a **~20 MB** asset without a change ticket fight?
- Do I need **five installers** for SQL + Redis + Kafka + vector + search?
- Does the client ship **Electron** (another Chromium) or reuse **system WebView**?

Installer size and multi-engine reach matter before anyone opens Activity Monitor. RSS still matters — just **later**, and with a method note.

## Electron tax vs WebView: what you are actually buying

| | Typical Electron client | GoNavi (Wails) |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Chromium + Node | **Go + native / system WebView** |
| Installer | Hundreds of MB common | **~20–26 MB class** |
| “Lightweight” slogan risk | High if only download is quoted | Lower if three numbers stay separate |
| Memory claim hygiene | Must measure RSS separately | Same rule — we publish a Linux sample |

Neither stack makes AI safe by itself. Stack only answers **how the UI is packaged**. Production safety still needs human gates (see the AI article in this series).

## How to measure RSS yourself (copy this method)

When a vendor says “light,” ask them — or measure:

1. Note **version**, **OS**, **CPU arch**, and **which binary** (e.g. WebKit41).
2. Launch to an **empty workbench**; connect **zero** databases.
3. Wait **30–60 s** after UI is idle.
4. Record **main process RSS** and, if relevant, **helper / WebKit / GPU** processes.
5. Publish the sum **and** the parts — never only the flattering number.
6. Re-run with one live connection if you want a “day-two” figure; label it separately.

That is the bar GoNavi’s README sample tries to clear. Hold competitors to the same bar.

## When a “lightweight native” client is the wrong buy

Skip the lightweight pitch (including GoNavi’s) if you:

- Need a **niche JDBC** driver only a JVM tool ships today
- Want a **pure terminal** workflow (`psql` + editor) and never open a grid
- Require a **cloud-only SaaS** SQL IDE with zero desktop install
- Only use **one** commercial RDBMS and already love a paid native SQL UI

Honesty here converts better than stacking every MB claim on one slide.


## Multi-engine reach still counts as “light”

Lightweight is not only process math. On a locked laptop, **five companion GUIs** are heavier than one 25 MB installer — even if each companion looks “small” alone.

A practical day-one set people try to collapse:

- Relational SQL client
- Redis / cache browser
- Document or vector UI
- Kafka / MQ console
- SSH / tunnel habits that never lived inside the SQL app

GoNavi’s workbench pitch is: keep SQL · cache · vector · MQ · search · time-series · domestic engines in **one sidebar**, so “lightweight” includes **fewer installs**, not only a smaller Chromium tax. You still will not replace every specialist tool on day one; you cut the tray that made LibreDB-style complaints go viral.

## What to put in your next comparison blog post

If you write “GoNavi vs X” for SEO, use this skeleton so you do not recreate the trap:

1. **State the three columns** up front (installer / RSS / stack).
2. **Cite versions** for every MB number.
3. **One method paragraph** for any RSS figure (OS, idle vs load, helpers counted or not).
4. **Separate** “multi-engine cockpit” from “RAM winner.”
5. **Never** invent Search Console traffic or unverified “~80 MB native” as a GoNavi claim.
6. Link readers to measure on **their** Windows / macOS box — cloud Linux samples travel poorly without a caveat.

That skeleton is how this page tries to rank: decision clarity, not slogan density.

## FAQ

**Is a 20 MB installer “lighter” than a 400 MB RSS?**  
Different columns. Small installers win IT gates; RSS wins RAM debates. Compare like with like.

**Is GoNavi fully “native UI”?**  
It is **Go + system WebView**, not Electron, and not a claim of 100% toolkit-native widgets. Say the stack out loud.

**Why publish hundreds of MB RSS at all?**  
Because hiding it would recreate the marketing mess this article argues against. A labeled sample beats a silent boast.

**Where do the numbers come from?**  
Installer sizes: GoNavi **v0.9.8** GitHub Release assets. RSS: one Linux cloud run described above. No invented Search Console or leaderboard rankings.

## Bottom line

A **lightweight native database client** search should force three columns: **installer**, **RSS**, **UI stack**. GoNavi’s honest pitch is small **~20–26 MB** installers, **non-Electron** WebView packaging, and a **labeled** Linux RSS sample — plus one multi-engine workbench so you install fewer companion GUIs on a locked laptop.
