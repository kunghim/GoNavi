/**
 * The sidebar explorer's object-kind filter: which dimension the tree is narrowed
 * to, and how a tree is narrowed to it.
 *
 * Extracted from `sidebarV2Utils`, which is well past the repo's file-size limit
 * and must not absorb new branches (AGENTS.md §1.1). Everything here is pure, so
 * the narrowing rules are unit-testable without mounting the sidebar.
 *
 * Two kinds of filter live side by side:
 *
 * - the relational object kinds (`tables`, `views`, …), which match on an
 *   `object-group`'s `dataRef.groupKey` and on the object node types below it;
 * - the Nacos workbench kinds (`nacos-services`, `nacos-configs`), which select
 *   one of a namespace's two explorer branches.
 *
 * They share one union on purpose. `useSidebarSearchModel` and the sidebar tree
 * already route every filter through a single `v2ExplorerFilter` value, so
 * extending the union costs the wiring nothing, while a parallel Nacos-only filter
 * axis would have had to be threaded through all of it.
