/**
 * Shared hover-hint timing.
 *
 * antd defaults to 0.1s in and 0.1s out. At that speed a hint fires while the
 * pointer is still travelling towards a control, and it disappears the instant
 * the pointer leaves — so sweeping across a row of action buttons flashes a
 * different hint per button. A longer enter delay keeps hints out of the way
 * while aiming; a longer leave delay stops the blink when the pointer crosses
 * the gap between the trigger and the hint.
 *
 * Native `title` attributes cannot be tuned (the OS decides, roughly a second in
 * and instant out), so controls that need a hint use antd Tooltip with these
 * values instead of `title`.
